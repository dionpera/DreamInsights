        <h2>Mother - Nurturing and Protection</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of your mother often symbolizes the need for nurturing, emotional care, or protection. It may indicate unresolved feelings from childhood, or it could represent your desire for guidance and support. If the dream depicts a positive interaction with your mother, it might reflect feelings of safety, love, and care in your waking life.</p>
        <p>If the relationship with your mother in the dream is strained, it may suggest unresolved conflicts or emotional wounds that need healing.</p>
