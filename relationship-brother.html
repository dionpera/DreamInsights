        <h2>Brother - Bond and Rivalry</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of your brother may represent the bond between you and your family, particularly the sibling relationship. It may symbolize companionship, loyalty, and shared experiences. On the other hand, if there is conflict in the dream, it may reflect unresolved issues or competition between you and your brother in waking life.</p>
        <p>If your brother appears strong and supportive in the dream, it can indicate your feelings of security and support in your relationships. However, if your brother is distant or adversarial, it might reflect feelings of rivalry or a lack of connection.</p>
