        <h2>Terrace House - Balance and Social Connection</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of a terrace house can symbolize balance, stability, and the importance of social connection. Terrace houses are typically shared or located in densely populated areas, suggesting interconnectedness and the presence of close relationships with others. A terrace house dream may indicate your desire for community or a need to strike a balance between your private and social life.</p>
        <p>If the terrace house is well-kept and comfortable, it may suggest a healthy social life and a solid foundation in your personal relationships. However, if the house feels cramped, chaotic, or in disrepair, it may represent feelings of being overwhelmed, stressed, or disconnected from others.</p>
