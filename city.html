        <h2>City - Ambition and Social Life</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of a city often reflects ambition, social interactions, and a desire to succeed. A city is bustling, energetic, and full of opportunities, so a dream of a city might indicate your own desires for success, progress, and connection with others. If the city in your dream is chaotic or overwhelming, it might signify stress or feelings of being lost in the pursuit of your goals.</p>
