        <h2>Town - Community and Belonging</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of a town often symbolizes community, relationships, and a sense of belonging. A town represents a smaller, more intimate version of a city, which may indicate your current feelings about your social circles, family, and friends. If the town feels warm and inviting, it may reflect positive feelings of security and support within your community.</p>
        <p>If the town is isolated or unfamiliar, it might represent feelings of alienation or a desire for connection with others. The dream may also suggest a need to seek out or strengthen your relationships with people around you.</p>
