        <h2>Zoo - Control and Wild Nature</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of a zoo typically symbolizes control, confinement, and a desire to tame the wild aspects of life. A zoo is a place where wild animals are contained and observed, which might represent aspects of your life that are restricted, or the balance between your more primal instincts and your civilized behavior. If the zoo is peaceful and well-maintained, it may indicate a sense of order and control in your life.</p>
        <p>However, if the zoo is chaotic, with animals escaping or being mistreated, it could suggest a sense of imbalance, or that you're struggling to control or contain certain aspects of yourself or your life.</p>
