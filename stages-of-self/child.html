        <h2>Child - Innocence and Freedom</h2>
        <p>Dreaming about yourself as a child often symbolizes a connection to your inner child, representing innocence, creativity, and playfulness. It may indicate a need to reconnect with a carefree time in your life or to embrace your natural curiosity.</p>
        <p>Such dreams can also reflect unresolved childhood experiences or the need for healing and self-compassion as you navigate life’s challenges.</p>
