        <h2>Understanding the Baby Stage in Dreams</h2>
        <p>Dreaming about being a baby typically represents vulnerability, innocence, or a new beginning. It might indicate a need for protection or a desire to return to a simpler time of life.</p>
        <p>When dreaming of being a baby, it may symbolize feelings of helplessness, dependence, or a need to nurture your emotional well-being. It can also represent the early stages of a new project or a fresh start in your life.</p>
