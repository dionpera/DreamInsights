        <h2>Dead - Transformation and Endings</h2>
        <p>Dreaming about being dead can symbolize the end of a chapter in your life, paving the way for personal growth and transformation. It may represent the shedding of old habits, beliefs, or relationships that no longer serve you.</p>
        <p>These dreams might also reflect fears or anxieties about mortality or a deeper understanding of life’s impermanence. They can encourage introspection and acceptance of change as part of personal evolution.</p>
