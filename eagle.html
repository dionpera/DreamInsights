        <h2>Eagle - Higher Perspective</h2>
        <p>The eagle is a symbol of vision, perspective, and freedom. Dreaming of an eagle may suggest that you need to rise above the challenges in your life and see things from a higher perspective. It may indicate a desire to break free from constraints or limitations in your life.</p>
        <p>If the eagle is flying high, it may suggest you are about to gain clarity on a situation, or that you should trust your intuition and instincts to guide you.</p>
