    <!-- Meaning of Dreaming about a Stranger -->
    <section class="meaning">
        <h2>Stranger - Unknown Aspects of Yourself</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of a stranger can symbolize the unknown aspects of yourself or your life. A stranger may represent hidden or suppressed emotions, thoughts, or desires that you have yet to confront or understand. It might also indicate feelings of insecurity or fear of the unknown in your waking life.</p>
        <p>If the stranger in the dream is friendly, it may suggest an opportunity to explore new possibilities or relationships. On the other hand, if the stranger is threatening or frightening, it could symbolize unresolved fears, anxieties, or a need to face uncomfortable truths about yourself or others.</p>
