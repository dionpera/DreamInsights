        <h2>Motorway - Journey and Direction</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of a motorway often symbolizes the direction and speed of your life's journey. Motorways are fast-paced roads that take you quickly from one place to another, suggesting that you may be moving quickly toward a goal or life stage. It could also indicate the need to focus on the road ahead and keep your eyes on the larger objective.</p>
        <p>If you're stuck in traffic or feel lost on the motorway, it might represent obstacles or delays in your life. Alternatively, a sense of freedom on the motorway could indicate that you're on the right path and feel empowered in your journey.</p>
