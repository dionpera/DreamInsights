        <h2>Snake - Transformation</h2>
        <p>Snakes often symbolize transformation and renewal in dreams. They represent change, both physical and psychological. If you dream of a snake, it may signify that you are going through a personal transformation, or it could indicate that something in your life needs to shed its old form to allow for growth and healing.</p>
        <p>However, a venomous or aggressive snake may signify hidden fears or danger in your life. It could also reflect unresolved issues that need to be dealt with for your personal growth.</p>
