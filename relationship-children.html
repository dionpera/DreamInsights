        <h2>Children - Innocence and Responsibility</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of children may symbolize innocence, new beginnings, or personal growth. Children often represent purity and joy, but they can also reflect your desires for nurturing, protection, or a longing for simpler times. Dreaming of your own children may indicate your sense of responsibility or the need to protect something important to you.</p>
        <p>If the child in your dream is happy and healthy, it may represent your desire for joy and fulfillment in your life. However, if the child is distressed, it could reflect concerns about your responsibilities, feelings of inadequacy, or a need to care for something vulnerable in your waking life.</p>
