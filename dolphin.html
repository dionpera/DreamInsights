        <h2>Dolphin - Emotional Healing</h2>
        <p>Dolphins in dreams often symbolize emotional healing, harmony, and connection. If you dream of a dolphin, it may signify the need to reconnect with your own emotions, or the desire for peace and serenity in your life. Dolphins are known for their playful and free-spirited nature, so seeing one may suggest you're ready to release stress and embrace joy.</p>
