        <h2>Garden - Growth and Fertility</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of a garden often symbolizes growth, renewal, and fertility. Gardens are places where things are cultivated and allowed to flourish, and this can represent personal development, new beginnings, or creativity in your life. If you dream of a garden that is blooming and well-kept, it may signify a period of growth and positive change.</p>
        <p>If the garden is overgrown or neglected, it might indicate a lack of attention or care in some area of your life, or feelings of unfulfilled potential. Gardens may also represent a desire to cultivate harmony and beauty in your environment.</p>
