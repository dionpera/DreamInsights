        <h2>Lion - Strength and Courage</h2>
        <p>The lion symbolizes strength, courage, and leadership. Dreaming of a lion can represent your inner strength or your need to assert yourself in a situation. It might also indicate a powerful influence in your life, or your own desire to become more confident.</p>
        <p>If the lion is aggressive, it may indicate unresolved anger or a need to control certain situations. If the lion is calm, it may indicate a harmonious state of confidence.</p>
