        <h2>Park - Relaxation and Nature</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of a park can symbolize relaxation, peace, and a return to nature. Parks are often places where people go to unwind and enjoy some quiet time, so a park in your dream might represent a need to take a break from the stresses of daily life and reconnect with your inner peace. If you dream of a park, it may indicate your need to find balance and take time for self-care.</p>
        <p>If the park is lively and full of people, it may symbolize a desire for social connection or rejuvenation. On the other hand, a park that is empty or unkempt might point to feelings of neglect or disconnection from nature or yourself.</p>
