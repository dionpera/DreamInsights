        <h2>Father - Authority and Protection</h2>
        <p>Dreams about your father often symbolize authority, protection, and the need for guidance. If you dream of your father, it may reflect your relationship with authority figures in your life, or your need for guidance and security. Positive interactions may symbolize feelings of safety, respect, and support, while negative interactions may point to unresolved issues with authority or lack of guidance.</p>
