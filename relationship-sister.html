        <h2>Sister - Support and Protection</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of your sister may symbolize a nurturing and protective relationship. Sisters often represent empathy, care, and understanding. If your sister is present in a dream, it may indicate a need for support or guidance in your waking life. It can also symbolize a close bond, whether it's one of affection or rivalry.</p>
        <p>If you are getting along with your sister in the dream, it can suggest harmony and a healthy emotional connection. However, conflicts with your sister in a dream may indicate unresolved tensions or issues in your real-life relationship.</p>
