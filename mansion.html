        <h2>Mansion - Wealth and Status</h2>
        <p>Dreaming of a mansion often symbolizes wealth, status, and success. Mansions are grand and luxurious, representing aspirations for a high level of achievement or desire for material success. This dream may reflect your ambitions, your desire to be recognized, or your need to feel important in the eyes of others.</p>
        <p>If the mansion in your dream is well-kept and impressive, it may indicate that you are on the right path to achieving your goals. However, if the mansion is empty, neglected, or in disrepair, it may suggest feelings of isolation, unfulfilled ambitions, or a fear of losing the things you value.</p>
